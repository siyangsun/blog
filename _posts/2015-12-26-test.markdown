Hello! This is my first blog post using Jekyll. I will continue to update this site as well as my main site as I become more familiar with Jekyll and Markdown. For now I am working on changing the style sheet for the Jekyll pages from the default style sheet. You can find out more about Jekyll and static page generation [here][Jekyll_site].
