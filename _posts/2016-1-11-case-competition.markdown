This past weekend I participated in the UCLA Kaiser Permanente Case Competition. I recently joined UCLA's Bruin Actuarial Society, in an attempt to figure out what I want to do with my life or something of that nature. BAS doesn't meet regularly, but often puts on events to get its members familiar with actuarial science. They especially put emphasis on the social and interpersonal aspects, as they say you can learn all the math and industry skills in class. I should have realized then that this competition that they put on would focus heavily on presentation and delivery rather than raw calculation correctness. The groups were set up so that at least two of the four people had to be underclassmen, to give freshmen a better chance in moving on. I was approached by someone I knew from playing briefly together in a League tournament (we never really played often, but we also never lost so there's that), so I joined his group and we were basically set. We received the email containing the information a while later; a six page document containing the situation the company (UC health insurance) was going through and what kinds of things they wanted us to take into account in finding a solution, and five dense spreadsheets loaded with financial data and assumptions. That night we spent four hours just reading the text part of the case. The following days would consist of very little sleep and very much number crunching. I think we went through several interpretations of the case and an uncountable number of iterations of our final strategy; in the end we missed the target profit margin of 10% by a sizeable amount, but we were confident that our methods were sound and that we knew what we were talking about. We spent so long on the calculations that by the time we finish it was 8am the next day, and we ended up with a very minimalistic slideshow presentation to work with by the deadline. Oh well, they always told us not to put too many numbers right?

Here's one-third of a sheet that we ended up completely scrapping.

It was the hardest thing I've ever done. It was the hardest I've ever worked. And we didn't make it. We didn't make it to the next round. Our presentation wasn't good enough for them. Bold, maybe, but not good enough. We took the whole "not too many numbers" thing a little too far and our presentation became difficult to understand. Our profit margins were far short of what the goals were. By any and all means we failed. But all I really felt was relief; moving on was an afterthought. We did everything we possibly could have done at the time, and I can't not be happy about that. I've recently been watching a show about people who work very hard; their hardest; and don't make it, all while surrounded by those who seem to succeed like second nature. The main character spends every waking moment trying to develop a game for a competition; however, in the later rounds of this, he is beaten out by a game of the same genre. He feels absolute despair as he did his best and still couldn't make it. I might write another more detailed, abstract article about this show later, but the point is, I don't feel the same way. I feel successful that I tried so hard at something, that I was able to devote 40 hours of absolute effort to a project that I cared about. I felt that I learned so much about the topic and about myself that there was no way I could feel despair when all I can feel is hopeful for the future.

Note: sorry if the formatting is boring in these first few posts. I still don't know too much markdown to format it at anything faster than I can google.
