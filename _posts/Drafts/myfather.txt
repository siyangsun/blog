It's unfair of me to criticize my father. He gave me everything he could and taught me everything he knew how.
My father taught me how to swim. My father taught me advanced mathematics. My father spent years building model rockets with me. I was cutting paper cylinders to milimeter precision and cementing two-tone epoxy by the age of twelve. My father taught me how to think, and how to perceive the way the world worked as dictated by the laws of nature. But my father never taught me how to be a man. I was never given the talk. No one spoke of women in my household other than something to beware of during my studies. There were a couple years that my father was not in my life; in Utah, for work. I was thirteen years old living alone in a house with my mother, a woman thirty years past my age. How could we understand each other? In the end, though, we made it work. Food was cooked, eaten, months of studies were completed. In hindsight my end of the deal was not nearly as big a burden, but I was willing to comply. However, these were my growing years. I don't mean physically; that wouldn't come for quite some time, to my chagrin. Psychologically, though, I was changing to a more emotional creature that unfortunately could no longer understand the world. Emotions were something I couldn't analyze logically as I'd been taught (yet..), and that frustrated me. It was difficult to understand myself, and what was changing. Perhaps one should learn those things alone; it builds character. In my case I'd like to think it did, though it sure took long enough.
