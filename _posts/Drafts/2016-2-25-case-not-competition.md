So, I started another case competition this past week. With the same group, of course; a case competition group is a bond that stays for life. Or at least, it is when all of you can't be bothered to find a different group when it already kind of worked out pretty well. If it ain't yelling at itself at 2 in the morning, don't fix it. 

--My drafts folder on github isn't working how it's supposed to, so bear with me with this big empty space (I know, I'm scared of them too..) while I finish actually writing this post--
